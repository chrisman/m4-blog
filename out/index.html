<h2 id="whats-a-backstory">What’s a backstory?</h2>
<p>A backstory is a collection of personality traits, and some kind of a narrative explanation for them. A context and an origin for your character.</p>
<p>It’s a collection of people, places, and things that ground you into the setting, connect you to the world, and relate you to your fellow players.</p>
<p>It’s a sort of <em>justification</em> for your character’s quirks.</p>
<p>Consider Severus Snape. He is cold, sarcastic, and bitter. If that was it, if that was all we got from him in the story, he’d be a terrible and boring character. Fortunately, he has a really exceptional backstory that explains where he came from and how he got where he is. Consequently we know that he is in fact a <em>great</em> character.</p>
<h2 id="why-create-a-backstory">Why create a backstory?</h2>
<p>Creating a backstory will benefit three different parties: you, your DM, and your teammates.</p>
<h3 id="backstory-for-you">Backstory For You</h3>
<p>Role playing is hard if you have a flat character and if you know nothing about them. If you come up with a little story about your character, you’ll get a better idea for who they are and how they should act in certain situations.</p>
<p>Also, backstory creation and character creation go really hand in hand, and one can inform the other. Your emerging backstory, for example, might determine the background or feat you take.</p>
<h3 id="backstory-for-your-dm">Backstory For Your DM</h3>
<p>If you include “hooks” in your backstory, like the name of a childhood mentor or a loved one, or the name of the town you’re from, or an organization you belong to, then your DM can have those people and places show up in story for great narrative payoff.</p>
<p>It can make coming up with meaningful and satisfying story lines for your character that much easier.</p>
<h3 id="backstory-for-your-teammates">Backstory For Your Teammates</h3>
<p>It gives you a way to talk about your character to your teammates, and creates a context in which they can interact with you.</p>
<p>And context here can mean empathy. It is much easier to forgive–or celebrate!–your character’s odd choices or behaviors if they’re explained by a good backstory.</p>
<p>Note: for this to work, you must actually tell your teammates, in character or out, your character’s backstory! Think about Snape again. If nobody ever found out about his backstory, he’d remain nothing but a terrible child abuser.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-backstory">How to backstory?</h2>
<p>Here are some resources for making a good and fun backstory.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Puzzle Pieces</strong>: Make your story like a puzzle piece that fits in with your fellow players, and in with your DM’s world.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Knife Theory</strong>: Include a few “knives” in your story that your DM can use to (lovingly) stab you in the back later.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rumors</strong>: Create some rumors about your character for NPCs to talk about and react to.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Megaversal Omnigroovy Background Machine</strong>: For extra fun, roll on the M.O.B. Machine tables to fill in some extra detail in your backstory</p></li>
</ol>
<p>More on each below.</p>
<h3 id="puzzle-pieces">Puzzle Pieces</h3>
<p>The best thing you can do is to have the edges of your backstory fit the edges of your DM’s world and of your fellow players’ backstories.</p>
<p>Hook your story into some plot device or campaign detail.</p>
<p>Choose at least two of your teammates and work with them to intermesh your stories. Maybe the two of you were traveling companions. Or childhood friends who grew up friendly rivals.</p>
<p>Tales from the Loop makes this part of starting a campaign, and one of the things I enjoyed most about playing that game was how <em>connected</em> all the characters were from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Exercises:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick 1 - 2 teammates. How do you know them?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="knife-theory">Knife Theory</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When writing a character’s backstory, it’s important to include a certain number of “knives”. Knives are essentially anything that the DM can use to raise the stakes of a situation for your character. Anything that can make a conflict personal, like a threatened loved one or the appearance of a sudden enemy. They’re called “knives” because the players lovingly forge them and present them to the DM so that the DM can use them to stab the player over and over again.</p>
<p><cite><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/775caq/my_friends_and_i_have_something_called_knife/">source</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try to include 3 - 5 knives.</p>
<p>Suggestions: at the very least, include one person, and one location, and one organization/family. Even if in your backstory you literally write “Insert Town Name Here” instead of a town name. You can work with your DM to fill in those kinds of details.</p>
<p>Each of the following is an example of one knife.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a named person your character cares about, living or dead, or an enemy your character has.</p></li>
<li><p>a precious item/heirloom.</p></li>
<li><p>an ongoing obligation or loyalty, or an obligation your character has failed.</p></li>
<li><p>a secret your character is keeping.</p></li>
<li><p>any phobia, trauma, or discrimination your character has experienced.</p></li>
<li><p>any mystery in your character’s life. e.g. unknown parents, unexplained powers.</p></li>
<li><p>a serious crime your character has committed or been falsely accused of.</p></li>
<li><p>a personal goal or objective based on any of the above knives.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rumors">Rumors</h3>
<p>Do this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Come up with 2 - 3 rumors about your character that are true.</p></li>
<li><p>Come up with 2 - 3 rumors about your character that are false.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it. Let your DM use them as they will.</p>

<p>So if you have a couple of “knives” now from the previous section, it is possible that you may be wondering how to tie them together into a story. If that’s the case, you can roll on the table below to get a sort of starting point of a story that will tie them all together.</p>
<p>If you’ll forgive me the sin of mixing my metaphors, those knives can be the <em>bones</em> of your story, and the narrative you build around them can be like the muscles and sinew that hold the bones together. And when you’re finished, you’ll have a gross, fleshless, sinewy skeleton thing of a backstory. Because creation isn’t pretty. But it is beautiful, and this is <em>your</em> little abomination backstory you’re creating here. Your own precious little insult to nature to cherish and adore and dress up in outfits and hope that nobody looks closely enough to see what lies beneath its wrappings.</p>
<p>Instructions: Roll 1d100 two or three times.</p>
<p>Note: This table is from a comedy RPG. If you roll and your result is too silly for your tastes, discard it and roll again.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>5e Dungeons &amp; Dragons does a good job of codifying some of these ideas into character creation with its system of traits/ideals/bonds/flaws, and backgrounds. It’s a great way to introduce the idea of role playing to somebody who has never done it before. Which is totally on brand for 5e. It’s the accessible, easy to pick up game.</p>
<p>It can quickly become creatively unsatisfying though to have those features assigned to through game mechanics or random rolls. That’s why I offer some of these tools to help you start fleshing out your character some more without necessarily relying on what the game tells you your options are.</p>
